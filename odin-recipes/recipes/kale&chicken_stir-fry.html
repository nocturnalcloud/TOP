    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (8 ounce) boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 sweet potato</li>
        <li>1 sweet potato</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 bunch chopped kale</li>
        <li>4 mini bell peppers, halved lengthwise and seeded</li>
        <li>½ medium red onion, cut into bite-size pieces</li>
        <li>½ zucchini, sliced</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons peanut sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Lightly season chicken breasts on both sides with salt and pepper.

        </li>
        <li>Heat a cast iron skillet over medium heat and pan-fry chicken until 
            it is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, turning 
            occasionally, about 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted 
            into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove 
            from skillet, allow to cool, and cut into bite-sized pieces.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, pierce sweet potato with a fork a few times and microwave until
             fork-tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Be careful not to overcook. Remove and allow
              to cool; then cut into bite-sized pieces.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a wok, Dutch oven, or heavy skillet over medium heat. Add kale, 
            season with salt and pepper, and cook until wilted, 3 to 5 minutes. Add sweet 
            potato, mini peppers, onion, zucchini, and garlic. Stir-fry for 3 to 5 minutes. 
            Add chicken and peanut sauce. Stir all ingredients together until well combined. 
            Cook and stir for 3 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
